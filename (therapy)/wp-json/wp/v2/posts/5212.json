Finally, the start-up expects a drastic reduction in the cost per<br \/>\npatient.<\/p>\n<p>This grant comes at a crucial time in the start-up&rsquo;s development: production of its biomedicine at an<br \/>\nindustrial large-scale to produce clinical batches. This will bring the company closer to a phase I\/IIa<br \/>\nclinical trial, for which a partnership agreement with the Paul Brousse Hospital, the 1st liver transplant<br \/>\ncenter in France, has already been signed.<br \/>\n\u00ab\u00a0At our current stage of development, finding private funding is not easy because our technology is<br \/>\ntruly revolutionary but recent in the pharmaceutical industry. In general, investors prefer to support<br \/>\nbiotechs at a more advanced stage and\/or with production technologies already proven in industry.<\/p>\n<p>Receiving a significant public fund is a real boost for our development in France and we thank the<br \/>\nFrench Government for supporting our strategic sector and for having selected our project. Cell<br \/>\ntherapy today is a bit like mRNA 10 years ago: Great potential, but a new pharmaceutical industry has<br \/>\nto be built, and this did not make investors dream, whereas today it has made it possible to developthe first vaccines against COVID-19 in record time. We believe that cell therapy, and pluripotent stem<br \/>\ncells in particular, will revolutionize patient care. While GoLiver Therapeutics is primarily focused on<br \/>\nliver disease, our cell therapy may offer solutions for the treatment of other organs.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that France has all the assets to become a leader in the cell therapy industry. We want to contribute to this<br \/>\nat our humble level, because it is in France that we want to write the future of GoLiver Therapeutics<br \/>\nand we hope to attract visionary and audacious investors like us.\u00a0\u00bb said Tuan Huy Nguyen, President of GoLiver Therapeutics.<\/p>\n<p>\u00ab\u00a0Liver transplantation is used in cases of terminal liver failure. The patient must then take lifelong<br \/>\nimmunosuppressive treatment to modulate the immune defenses and thus reduce graft rejection. This<br \/>\ntreatment has certain side effects. What is the alternative to transplantation? Regenerative medicine<br \/>\nfor severe liver failure holds promise for avoiding transplantation. Goliver Therapeutics proposes a<br \/>\nsolution based on the capacity of one\u2019s own liver cells to regenerate, it is a treatment of the future.\u00a0\u00bb<br \/>\nsays Andr\u00e9 Le Tutour, Vice-President of TransHepate, the National Federation of Liver Patients and<br \/>\nTransplants and President-Founder of the Regional Association TransHepate Bretagne Ouest at the<br \/>\nUniversity Hospital of Rennes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About GoLiver Therapeutics &#8211; https:\/\/golivertx.com\/<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>GoLiver Therapeutics is a spin-off created in 2017 from Inserm and the University of Nantes (CRTI<br \/>\nUMR1064) focused on developing Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) to meet a major<br \/>\nmedical need in liver transplantation. GoLiver Therapeutics aims to become a world leader in the<br \/>\nregenerative medicine field by tackling liver regeneration, by conducting the first clinical studies and<br \/>\nbringing the first innovative cell-based drug for treating liver diseases without the need for transplant<br \/>\nby using the breakthrough technology of pluripotent stem cells.<\/p>\n<p>Receiving the Seal of Excellence of the European Union in 2020, highlighted by Challenges magazine<br \/>\nas one of the \u201c100 start-ups to invest in\u201d for 2019, GoLiver Therapeutics has been awarded the France<br \/>\nFrench Transfer Invest 2019, the i-LAB 2016 national Grand Prize for health biotechs and i-LAB 2015<br \/>\nin the emerging start-ups category.
